    <p>Zaya and Miguel are friends.</p>
    <p>One day, they went to a park after school.</p>
    <p>They talk about their new friend, Riley.</p>
    <p>Riley and Miguel like soccer.</p>
    <p>Zaya didn't like soccer.</p>
    <p>She felt sad.</p>
    <p>At home, Zaya told her dad how she felt.</p>
    <p>Zaya was scared she would feel left out.</p>
    <p>Zaya's dad told her that it was good to make new friends.</p>
    <p>Zaya went outside to see Miguel and Riley.</p>
    <p>Riley gave Zaya a high five.</p>
    <p>The three new friends played all afternoon!</p>
